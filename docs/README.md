- Custom HTML, Custom CSS, CSS Flexbox, CSS variable roots, CSS Keyframes animations, Custom Javascript
- Github Repo: <https://github.com/emidombek/darkwood>
- Page structure:
     
   1. Landing Page: index.html
   
      - This is a page designed to introduce the user to the feel and atmosphere of the game and to set up the user experience. It also acts as a 'gateway' to the user providing a link to the game at the end of a short animation sequence. 

      - It consists of a Header with the Game Title. The body contains an image of a symbol and a fade-in fade-out fade-in Keyframes animation consisting of two different elements. 

      - An element with some intro text and another element with an entry link for the game. The second link element has an additional Keyframes glow animation designed to highlight and entice the user to click on it.

      - The footer contains a link to my LinkedIn profile as well as my GitHub profile.

      - There is also an animated background (canvas element + js) consisting of small 'fireflies' flying around. The js for this animation and the keyframes fade in-out effects are contained within a separate graphics.js file to the game js which is in the script.js file.

   2. Game Page: game.html
   
      - The actual game is located on this page. 

      - When the user first enters the game it load with an overlay and a click-to-start mechanism. After the user clicks on the text the overlay is removed and the game starts.

      - The page itself consists of a Header with the Game Title. There is also a sub-heading container in the header that contains 3 labeled icons that are part of the game elements. These elements are the game score display, an instructions pop-up and a timer for each round.

      - The body consists of a fake 'grid' (a container with columns and rows)+ 2 rows containing, 8 dynamically generated cards in JS in pairs.
   
      - Within the game, there is a total of 16 different cards based on mythological beings from different regions (West, East and Southern Slavic Countries). Each round a new set of 4 matching pairs are placed within the game. Once the user starts the game they must match all 8 cards to progress, if the user runs out of time they will be prompted with a 
  
      - Beneath the 'card grid' there is an instructions-controls container that holds 3 additional elements: an alternating pause/play button (depending on whether the user pauses the game), a home icon with a link back to the index page and a restart button to restart the game completely.
     
      - The footer contains links to my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
  
      - This page also uses the same animated background as the entry page. It also uses the keyframes glowing/glow animation to highlight certain clickable icons/text.

## üñå Design and Layout

The design and layout of this website was created in Figma. A moodboard and wireframes were designed from scratch to help develop the look and feel of the game. Keyframes animations help emphasize important links and icons. Javascript for the background and Keyframes animations are stored in a different graphics.js file than the actual game code which is located in script.js. The setting of the game is inspired by Slavic mythology and the Witcher games/tv series/books.

## ü§ñ Code

The majority of this game is written in custom Javascript, with custom CSS + Keyframes animations for styling as well as custom HTML. 

   <details>
   <summary>HTML Summary</summary>

   - HTML: The HTML used is a pretty standard implementation for both the index.html page and the game.html it includes a     Head, Header, Body and Footer for each page. The index.html serves as an entry point for the game.html displaying a p element entry text that reveals an entry link element to the user via a CSS/Javascript keyframes animation sequence. 
  
   - The game.html page has containers that hold the game features and links: a Score icon/text with a span to display the game score, an icon with a pop-up trigger that triggers a pop-up containing game instructions and a timer icon with a span that displays the time remaining in the current round at the top. The main section holds the fake 'grid' or just a container with rows and grid game rows that hold the eight cards that are generated dynamically in Javascript. Below the card containers, there is another container with some controls and a link: the play/pause icon/text is a span that is toggled via JS depending on the game state function currently active, a home icon/text that contains a link back to the index Landing Page and a restart icon/text that triggers the restart game function in JS. The social media list items in the footer of both pages were taken from the Love Running project which will be listed in the resources below.

   - A highlight of the HTML implementation of the **canvas** element on both pages which is used to facilitate the display of the background 'Firefly' Javascript animation.

   - Another highlight of the HTML is the elements on the index.html which facilitate the fade-in fade-out fade-in keyframes animation sequence.

   - The game.html page besides holding the containers for the dynamically created cards and game controls + displays and links has containers that hold several pop-ups that are further styled and controlled in the script.js file.

   <details>
   <summary>CSS Summary</summary>

   - The CSS for this game is pretty standard, it imports the Nova Cut font from google fonts. The root variables define various colors, font families, and line height to maintain consistency throughout the game. 

   - The CSS includes global styles for the body, main, and header elements, setting the background image and layout. It also configures the **canvas** element for firefly-like graphics animation found in the graphics.js file. There is also a setting at the very top that removes global settings (credit to my mentor Juliia). 
  
   - Highlights of the CSS include some elements including being styled to be initially hidden to facilitate various effects:

    1. .entry-link: The "Enter" link on the entry page is initially hidden. It becomes visible later with a fade-in effect.
    2. .hidden: This class is used to hide elements. It's not directly applied to any specific element in the given CSS, but it's likely used in JavaScript or dynamically added to elements for certain interactions.
    3. .fa-play: The play icon used in pop-up elements is initially hidden.
    4. #playText: This element, likely a text label for the play icon, is initially hidden.
  
   - The CSS file also defines animations via Keyframes for fade-in and glowing effects on elements. Resources for the Keyframes animations will be listed below.
   
   </details>

   *Javascript*

   The Javascript in this project is divided into two different files, the first file is the *graphics.js* file where the background fireflies animation is created and Keyframes fade-in fade-out sequence is controlled. This file is used on both of the web pages. The second file script.js is where the actual code that runs the game lives. This file is only used within the game.html webpage. 

   <details>
   <summary>View a summary of graphics.js</summary>


   The entire code is wrapped in a 'DOMContentLoaded' event listener to ensure that the JavaScript code inside the event listener runs only after the DOM has been fully loaded and parsed.  

   This file is divided into two sections:
